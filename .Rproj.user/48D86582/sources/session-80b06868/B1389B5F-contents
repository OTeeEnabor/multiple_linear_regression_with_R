## Background

What physical characteristics of human can we use to determine their intelligence? This question has been fundamental to the study of human intelligence. A group of research who set out to answer the question "***Are a person's brain size and body size predictive of his or her intelligence"?*** collected a sample of 38 college students.

The researchers collected the following variables for each student in their sample:

-   Response (*y*): performance IQ scores (PIQ) from the revised Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. The researchers used this as the measure of a person's intelligence.

-    **Potential predictor** (x1): Size of the brain based on the count obtained from MRI scans (measured as count per 10 000)

-   Potential predictor (x2): Height in inches

-   Potential predictor (x3): Weight in poinds

## Load data set

```{r}
# read in the dataset
df <-  read_table(here::here("IQ_vs_Physical_Characteristics/data/raw/index.txt"))
# show first 6 observations
head(df)
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r}
#| label: fig-scatter-matrix1
#| fig-cap: Scatter-plot matrix (base) showing the pair-wise relationship between the variables of the dataset.
# Scatter plot matrix in base R
pairs(~PIQ + Brain + Height + Weight, data = df, lower.panel = panel.smooth)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-scatter-matrix2
#| fig-cap: Scatter-plot matrix showing the pair-wise relationship between the variables of the dataset.
df |> ggpairs(
  columns = c("PIQ", "Brain", "Weight", "Height"),
  upper = list(continuous = wrap("cor", size= 8))
) 
```

The scatter plot is simply for data checking - any errors in the data? The scatter plots also show the **marginal relationships** between each variable pair without including the other variables. From Figure @fig-scatter-matrix2, we can see that the **brain size** could be a strong candidate for a predictor of intelligence based on the high correlation value $0.378$. However, since this is a multiple linear regression problem, we would like to see how the response variable is influenced by all three predictors simultaneously.

Regression analysis begins by formulating a model to represent our data set. The regression model for this case is stated below:

$$
y_i = (\beta_0 +\beta1x_{i1}+\beta2x_{i2}+\beta3x_{i3})+\epsilon_i
$$

Where:

-   $y_i \text{ is the intelligence score (PIQ) of student}_i$

-   $x_i1 \text{ is the brain size (MRI) of student}_i$

-   $
    xi2 \text{ is the height (Height) of student}_i
    $

-   $
    x_{i3} \text{ is the weight (Weight) of student}_i
    $

-   $
    \epsilon_i \text{ is the independent error term that is normally distributed about 0 with equal variance } \sigma^2
    $

The purpose of doing a regression analysis is usually to answer a question about our data set. The following are possible research questions:

1.  Which predictors can explain the variation in the IQ scores of the students? (**conduct hypothesis tests for individually testing whether each slope could be 0.**)
2.  What is the effect of brain size on student IQ scores, after considering height and weight? (**Calculate and inerprete a confidence interval for the brain size slope parameter)**
3.  What is the PIQ of an individual with a given brain size, height, and weight? **(Calculate and interpret a prediction interval for the response)**

## Regression Model

```{r}
# create linear regression model
df.regression <- lm(PIQ ~ Brain+Height+Weight, data=df)
summary(df.regression)
```

From the summary information above, the regression equation for this model is as follows:

$PIQ = 111.4 + 2.060Brain \; - 2.73 Weight \; + 0.0006Height$

The summary information tells us the following:

-   The $R^2$ value of 0.2949 means that 29.49% of the variation in the response variable (PIQ) can be explained by the predictor variables - Brain, Weight, and Height

-   The p-value for the F-statistic (p=0.0072) indicates that the model with the chosen independent variables would perform better than a model that does not take into account these independent variables.

-   The p-values for the slope coefficients of Brain (P=0.000856) and Height (P=0.033) indicate that we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no linear relationship between these two variables and the response variable (PIQ). However, for the p-value for Weight (p=0.998) indicates that we cannot reject the null hypothesis.

# MLR: Underground Air Quality

## Background

Researchers (Colby, et al, 1987) set out to answer the research question - ***what are the breathing habits of baby birds that live in underground burrows?*** The researchers did a randomized experiment of n=120 nestling bank swallows. The experiment was conducted in an underground burrow, where the researchers varied the percentage of oxygen at 4 different levels (13%, 15%, 17%, and 19%) and the percentage of dioxide at 5 different levels (0%, 3%, 4.5%, 6%, and 9%). The resulting 20 experimental conditions, the researchers observed the total volume of air breathed per minute for each of 6 nestling bank swallows.

## Load data set

```{r}
df2 = read_table(here::here("Underground_Air_Quality/data/raw/index.txt"))
# show first 6 observations
head(df2)
```

The data set collected from the experiment is as follows:

-   **Response(y)**: percentage increase in "minute ventilation" (**Vent**), i.e, total volume of air breathed per minute.

-   **potential predictor (x1):** percentage of oxygen (O2) in the air baby birds are breathing

-   **potential predictor (x3):** percentage of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air baby birds breathe

## Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r}
#| label: fig-scatter-matrix3
#| fig-cap: Scatter-plot matrix showing the pair-wise relationship between the variables of the dataset.
df2 |> ggpairs(
  columns = c("Vent", "O2", "CO2"),
  upper = list(continuous = wrap("cor", size= 8))
) 
```

Figure @fig-scatter-matrix3 above informs us of the following:

-   There is a strong correlation between the response variable (Vent) and predictor variable (CO2)

-   There is a weak correlation between the response variable (Vent) and predictor variable (O2)

-   There is no correlation between the chosen conditions of the experiment - CO2 and O2

There is another plot that is widely used in MLR scenarios where there is 1 response variable and 2 predictor variables, the **bubble plot**

```{r}
ggplot(df2,
       aes(
         x=`Vent`,
         y=`O2`,
         size=`CO2`
       )) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.75)+
  scale_size(range=c(.1,10), name = "CO2 levels")

```

## Regression Model

A regression model for this problem is stated below

$$

$$

$$
y_{i} = \beta_{0} +\beta_{1}x_{i1} +\beta_{2}x_{i2} + \epsilon_{i}
$$

Where:

-   $y_i \text{ percentage of minute ventilation of nestling bank swallow}_i$

-   $x_{i1} \text{ percentage of oxygen exposed to nestling bank swallow}_i$

-   $ x_{i2} \text{ percentage of Carbon dioxide exposed to nestling bank swallow}_i $

-   $ \epsilon_i \text{ is the independent error term that is normally distributed about 0 with equal variance } \sigma^2 $

**Research Question**

-   Is oxygen related to minute ventilation, after taking into account carbon dioxide? (Conduct a hypothesis test for testing whether the O2 slope parameter is 0.)

-   Is carbon dioxide related to minute ventilation, after taking into account oxygen? (Conduct a hypothesis test for testing whether the CO2 slope parameter is 0.)

-   What is the mean minute ventilation of all nestling bank swallows whose breathing air is comprised of 15% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide? (Calculate and interpret a confidence interval for the mean response.)

```{r}
# create linear regression model
df2.regression <- lm(Vent ~ O2+CO2, data=df2)
summary(df2.regression)
```
